A spedy base for your modpacks

## IMPORTANT: Barebones

If you do not have or want to use a supported launcher, you may use the __barebones__ edition.

This is just a zip with the mods. Barebones editions can be found [here](https://github.com/Ast3risk-ops/speedbase/releases)

check the [wiki](https://speedbase.gitbook.io/docs) for info on how to install them.

## What is this modpack?

This modpack can serve as a base for your own modpacks, for distribution or not. The idea here is to make something that anybody can make their own version of.

Because it's MIT, you can upload those versions too!


## Info

This is my first modpack, and I am the sole maintainer.

<summary>Why did you make this?</summary>
<br>
I never liked using modpacks, I always preferred to make my own for personal use, I have a ton of those.

I also noticed that there was no proper mod that gave users a true Optifine experience besides Additive, which I sought to differentiate from.
